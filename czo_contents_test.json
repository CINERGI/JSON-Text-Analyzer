The probe was carried along the contour of the slope and recorded georeferenced measurements of specific conductance every one to two seconds. These measurements were started in November of 2014 and continued to be made every two months for a year after (November 2014 â\u0080\u0093 September 2015) by Caitlin Hodges. EMI provides information on soil specific conductance, which can then be used to infer soil moisture and texture conditions. When repeated measurements are made, soil moisture changes over time can be observed. This raw data is best utilized by importing into ArcMap and interpolating the specific conductivity measurements to generate a 2D map of soil conductivity. Hodges used the data to inform her installation of her rusted steel redox indicators in the watersheds to assess soil redox potential in the watersheds (first deployment, October 2015). \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: Measurements made every 2 months",

    "abstract": "Level 0 - Raw Data \n\t\t\t\t\nNatural gamma ray logs are indicating the concentration of thorium (Th), uranium (U), and potassium (K) in the rocks surrounding a borehole and they are a measurement of the natural radioactivity of the formation.  The energy of the gamma-rays (photons) differs for Th, U, and\nK. Potassium emits only gamma photons of energy 1.46 MeV. Thorium emits gamma photons of a number of different energies, the highest of which is 2.62 MeV. Uranium similarly emits gamma photons of a number of different energies with 1.76 MeV as the highest energy that can be detected in a borehole. Here the values indicate total gamma ray energy and are function of well depth. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Wire-line logging:  The natural gamma log system consists of a gamma ray detecting probe, geophysical logging cable and a digital counter instrument. It is done by lowering the probe down the drill hole and recoding the gamma radiation variation (in count-per-second) with depth (in meters).  Two data sets for each well:  Down and Up.  Down:  From top of the well to bottom of the well.  Up:  From bottom of the well to top of the well.  Depth in meters in first column and gamma radiation variations in count-per-second in the second column.",
