The probe was carried along the contour of the slope and recorded georeferenced measurements of specific conductance every one to two seconds. These measurements were started in November of 2014 and continued to be made every two months for a year after (November 2014 â\u0080\u0093 September 2015) by Caitlin Hodges. EMI provides information on soil specific conductance, which can then be used to infer soil moisture and texture conditions. When repeated measurements are made, soil moisture changes over time can be observed. This raw data is best utilized by importing into ArcMap and interpolating the specific conductivity measurements to generate a 2D map of soil conductivity. Hodges used the data to inform her installation of her rusted steel redox indicators in the watersheds to assess soil redox potential in the watersheds (first deployment, October 2015). \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: Measurements made every 2 months",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, particularly since the 2002 drought, the presence of Didymosphenia Geminata have significantly increased in Colorado mountain streams. Didymosphenia geminata is a nuisance algal species also known as \"didymo\" or \"rock snot\". Didymo can coat streambeds as a thick brown algal mat, with mats as thick as 1-2cm. Click here to get more details and microscopic views of D. geminata.\n\nA study was conducted along Boulder Creek from 2008-2010 to investigate factors affecting the removal of D. geminta. Samples of D. geminata were collected at various points Boulder Creek(see map) between June 2008 and September 2010. Metrics for measuring didymo growth includes Didymo Rating Index (DRI), ash-free-dry-mass(AFDM), chlorophyll concentration and didymo cell densities. Didymo Rating Index(DRI) is a qualitative way to gauge didymo growth. It ranges from 0, representing no obvious signs of didymo growth, to a maximum of 10, representing 100% coverage and mats greater than 5 cm thick. The maximum DRI for Boulder Creek was a 6 or 7 (100% coverage with a mat thickness of 1 to 2cm).\n\nResults of the study show the importance of taking into account site specific geomorphologic controls such as the potential for bed disturbance in addition to simple hydrologic controls such as variations in discharge. The results also show the importance of considering different controls for individual processes such distinguishing between the drivers of increased cell division or increased mat production in understanding the dynamics of complex ecological systems such as that presented by D. geminata.",

This data was collected in collaboration between the Boulder Creek CZO and the National Center for Airborne  Laser Mapping (NCALM), both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.

This data was collected in collaboration between the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) project and the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m2 LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format, approx. 1-2 GB each, with associated shaded relief models, for a total of 15 GB of data. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include snow-on data for 2010.",

Installation is expected to occur in the winter of 2015/2016. The continuously monitored gas wells target 3 different land use comparisons on flat upland topography. The land uses consist of a reference hardwood forest minimally degraded by human activity, 3 old-field secondary succession pine forests >60 years old, and 1 plowed agricultural plot which has been, to the best of our knowledge, continually cultivated from at least the 1930s. Two of the old-field pine plots will be subjected to a clear-cutting experiment with one serving as the control (uncut). The goal of this sampling is to identify anthropogenic biogeochemical signals in the soil profile of cultivated lands and to evaluate their persistence or lack thereof in old-field pine forests relative to reference hardwoods. Data will be logged on a Campbell datalogger. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Gasses measured include O2 (Apogee) and CO2 (Vaisala). \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: start date TBD, will be ongoing with data logged every 30 minutes",

Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.; PUBLICATIONS: .

Prenart suction cups are optimized for all chemistry analyses and were installed without addition of Si-slurry to allow for artifact-free Si analyses. Applied suction for each Prenart is ~ 50kPa and SoilMoisture suction cups are sampled with a suction of 70-80kpa. Both suction cup types are optimized for all chemistry analyses with the exception of dissolved organic matter in the case of the SoilMoisture ones (due to potential sorption of DOM on the porous ceramic material). Zero-tension samplers are optimized for water flux determination at saturated flow and sampling for various chemistry analyses. In Marshall Gulch there are 8 SoilMoisture suction cups in the schist site and 7 in the granite site in both convergent and divergent landscape positions. These soil solution samplers are co-located with piezometers measuring water table depth within the soil profile. In the Oracle Ridge site there are 8 pits each equipped with 2 Prenarts and 1 SoilMoisture ceramic cup lysimeter. These samplers are co-located with Decagon Em5b data loggers with EC-5 soil moisture sensors and ECT soil temperature sensors. The B2 Desert site Schist and a Granite sites are both equipped with 7 zero-tension samplers (Hinckley et al., 2008) in both divergent and convergent landscape positions as well one SoilMoisture ceramic cup lysimeter.

The set of lines are diagramed in GPR_grid_2013.xlsx.  Each group is identified by a line number given in FieldNotesWithLineNumbers.  The three sets are pre-infiltration, after water infiltration, and after dye infiltration.  The water infiltration pre-wet the soil to extend the range of the dye migration.  All of these were collected in a single day.   Duplicate radar lines provide a measure of data reproducibility and sensitivity.  Processed radargrams are available in the appendix of the Pitman masterâ\u0080\u0099s thesis.  Processing parameters are provided there.  A MALA GPR with 800 Mhz shielded antenna was used.  The sample interval was 0.1164 ns. The time window was 46.434 nanoseconds (400 samples per trace).  A trace was collected every 1 cm along the lines triggered by the Mala survey wheel attached to the antenna.  The antenna was pulled by hand, but guided by a rigid board for reproducible location.  A distance measuring wheel was used to encode the horizontal position.",

Samples were obtained by dipping new 50mL polypropylene (PP) tubes into stream channel.  Care was taken to sample upstream of any disturbance caused by entering stream channel.  Three tubes were filled at each sampling location and returned to Duke for filtration and analysis.  Each tube was labeled with sampling location reference number, and collection date.  In the lab, the 3 tubes from each sampling location were composited for vacuum filtration using Whatman Nuclepore 0.4 um polycarbonate membranes.  The filtered sample was divided into 3 new PP tubes and stored at 4C prior to analysis.  To analyze: 1) Dispense 20mLs of sample into glass tube; 2) Allow sample to reach equilibrium with room temp; 3) Calibrate temperature correction on YSI Model 32 Conductance Meter using 0.0001N, 0.0005N, and 0.001N KCl; 4) Immerse conductivity cell into sample, and swirl to eliminate air pockets; 5) Check range and temperature correction for each sample, adjust if necessary; 6) Allow reading to stabilize, record result in uS after stable for 30 sec; 7) Remove cell, place stir bar in tube, place tube on stir plate and mix for at least 15 minutes to allow sample to reach equilibrium with atmospheric CO2; 8) After calibrating pH meter (Brinkmann Model Phi 360) on pH 4 and 7 buffers, immerse pH electrode; 9) Reading may take several minutes to stabilize; 10) Record pH when change in value is less than 0.02 units on successive readings; 11) While continuously stirring, place titrator (Metrohm Model 665 Dosimat) dispensing tip in tube; 12) End of tip should align with bulb of electrode without touching; 13) Dispense titrant (0.005N HCl) until pH 5.00 is reached; 14) Record volume when endpoint is stable for 15 sec; 15) Convert volume to meq/L alkalinity.

In each case the sample is loaded into the machine without prior modification (no grinding) to an ideal thickness based on the amount of iron in the sample.  Transmission 57Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy was performed with a variable temperature He-cooled system with a 1024 channel detector.  A 57Co source (~50 mCi) embedded in a Rh matrix was used at room temperature.   Samples were mounted between two pieces of 0.127 mm thickness Kapton tape. In some cases, this was done inside an anoxic glovebox, and transferred immediately to the spectrometer cryostat to avoid sample oxidation prior to analysis. In other cases dried samples were used. The velocity (i.e., gamma-ray energy) was calibrated using a-Fe foil at 298 K. The transducer was operated in constant acceleration mode and folding was performed against the calibrated Fe foil to achieve a flat background. The raw sample files here are folded spectra using the most recent collected calibration standard. Data collection times are typically 24 h per sample per temperature, however can be longer/shorter in samples with less/more iron concentration. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Soil samples of enriched and depleted iron horizons were collected previously by Dan Richter and passed to Aaron Thompson in 2015. Each sample was previously air-dried. Dried samples were loaded into the MÃ¶ssbauer spec. at the University of Georgia, located in Barrow Hall on the main Athens campus and each sample was analyzed for ~24h at three temperatures (295K, 77K and 4.2K).

Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

    "abstract": "Exploration of the Geological Formations of the Luquillo Mountain Range of North Eastern Puerto Rico using X-ray Florescence \n\t\t\t\t\nX-ray Florescence (XRF) is a widely used non-destructive method that measures the elemental composition of materials. This technology was applied to investigate the rocks and sediments in the Luquillo Mountains / El Yunque region of Puerto Rico. Initial testing of wet and dry sediments revealed that the machine records higher elemental concentrations in dry compared to wet sediments as it seems that the water molecules interfere with the X-ray beam on wet samples. The XRF method on dried samples produced reliable results and allowed for the chemical separation of the five basic bedrock types found in the Luquillo Mountains. Of the volcanoclastic the Fajardo Formation can be distinguished from the others by its concentration of Barium (Ba) and Rubidium (Rb). The Unnamed formation was distinguished by Copper (Cu) and the Hato Puerto Formation was distinguished by Nickel (Ni) and Strontium (Sr). The Rio Blanco granodiorite is the youngest rock type of the region and was the only formation whose elemental chemistry was not distinguishable from the othersapparently because it was formed directly from the basic magma that also formed the Luquillo Mountains volcanic rocks. Recent studies have found high levels of Mercury (Hg) in Luquillo stream water. Knowing that the Luquillo region was heavily mined for Gold (Ag) and Silver (Au), the Hg used in historic mining is a possible source of the elevated Hg values. The XRF analysis indicated small quantities of Hg in some rocks but no Hg was found in the sediments and soils surrounding the historic mining sites. Therefore if Hg had been used in historic mining operations it is no longer apparent in the sediments and has presumably been removed by erosion of the site.",

Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

    "abstract": "Sampling depths of 40-50 cm and 400-500 cm \n\t\t\t\t\nDeep within soil profiles, organic matter (OM) inputs are derived from root growth and root exudates of deeply-rooted species, and organic compounds percolating through the profile from more shallow horizons.  Severe disturbance â\u0080\u009corphansâ\u0080\u009d these deep roots, which eventually decay in place.  When annual crops replace long-lived, deeply rooted vegetation, sustained organic inputs into deep soil volumes are limited to those that percolate down from the overlying horizons.  Multiple studies suggest that even after forests are re-planted, it can take more than a century for deep roots to become re-established.  \n\nWe thus ask if past disturbance and subsequent changes across depth in OM inputs (both content and form) have a contemporary influence on transformations and fate of deep, ancient soil OM and associated biogeochemical fluxes and microbial communities.  If so, this phenomenon would suggest a far-reaching nature of the biogeochemical legacies of past disturbance, both in vertical space (down deep) and time (~60 y after forest re-establishment at the Calhoun experimental forest).  Discerning and quantifying any such effect would add an additional dimension to existing disturbance-related literature, and helps address some of the questions raised in the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory proposal.\n\nOur objective was to quantify the influence of past land use history and current land cover on deep soil biogeochemical processes linked to OM transformations.  For this, we collected soil samples from the Calhoun CZO, from three replicate sites of old-grown hardwood forests, from three replicate sites of old-field pine forests, and from one current crop field (â\u0080\u009cdovefieldâ\u0080\u009d), from depths of 40-50 cm and 400-500 cm by hand augering. \n\nOnce the shipped soil samples arrived at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, we incubated subsamples in mason jars and prepared them for gas sampling. Gas samples from the incubation jars were at time 0 and time 1, and CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations in the sampled gas were analyzed with a gas chromatograph. This allowed us to compute rates of soil microbial CO2, CH4 and N2O production. Determining d13C of the sampled gases with a 13CO2/12CO2 gas analyzer allowed us to assess the d13C of the CO2 respired by the soil microbes. At the same sampling points during the soil incubations, we also took aliquots of the samples for flourometric enzyme assays. This aimed at quantifying the activities of the microbial extracellular enzymes Ã\u009f-glucosidase, Ã\u009f-N-acetyl glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, and phenol oxidase. \n\nAll other soil parameters were analyzed on subsamples of the soils immediately after their arrival at the University of Kansas. \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: irregular collections",

Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

    "abstract": "Stable Isotope (d18O and d2H) Data for Precipitation, Stream Water, and Groundwater in Puerto Rico \n\t\t\t\t\nLike many mountainous areas in the tropics, watersheds in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico have abundant rainfall and stream discharge and provide much of the water supply for the densely populated metropolitan areas nearby. Projected changes in regional temperature and atmospheric dynamics as a result of global warming suggest that water availability will be affected by changes in rainfall patterns. It is essential to understand the relative importance of different weather systems to water supply to determine how changes in rainfall patterns, interacting with geology and vegetation, will affect the water balance. To help determine the links between climate and water availability, stable isotope signatures of precipitation from different weather systems were established to identify those that are most important in maintaining streamflow and groundwater recharge. Precipitation stable isotope values in the Luquillo Mountains had a large range, from fog/cloud water with d2H, d18O values as high as +12 â\u0080°, -0.73 â\u0080° to tropical storm rain with values as low as -127 â\u0080°, -16.8 â\u0080°. Temporal isotope values exhibit a reverse seasonality from those observed in higher latitude continental watersheds, with higher isotopic values in the winter and lower values in the summer. Despite the higher volume of convective and low-pressure system rainfall, stable isotope analyses indicated that under the current rainfall regime, frequent trade -wind orographic showers contribute much of the groundwater recharge and stream base flow. Analysis of rain events using 20 years of 15 -minute resolution data at a mountain station (643 m) showed an increasing trend in rainfall amount, in agreement with increased precipitable water in the atmosphere, but differing from climate model projections of drying in the region. The mean intensity of rain events also showed an increasing trend. The determination of recharge sources from stable isotope tracers indicates that water supply will be affected if regional atmospheric dynamics change trade- wind orographic rainfall patterns in the Caribbean.\n\nFor more data a USGS open file report is available: Stable Isotope (d18O and d2H) Data for Precipitation, Stream Water, and Groundwater in Puerto Rico http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20141101",

Sparks, Anthony Aufdenkampe\nThe Christina River Basin-Critical Zone Observatory (CRB-CZO), located in the Piedmont region of Southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware, is a partnership between the University of Delaware and the Stroud Water Research Center. At Transect A of the White Clay Creek Watershed (WCCW) of the CRB-CZO, the composition of soil pore-waters and stream was investigated to understand how the geochemical dynamics of Fe- and Mn- along redox gradients affect the C cycle within a floodplain aquifer. \nSoil pore-water was collected with in-situ borosilicate glass samplers (50 mm long, 20 mm diameter, 1 Âµm pore size, Ecotech, Germany) with the attached PTFE (Teflon) tubes (3/1.5 mm i.d./o.d) to sampling bottle. Six samplers were deployed on both sides of the floodplain within a 10-40 cm thick dark organic-rich silty soil that represents a buried pre-settlement wetland soil, underlain gravel, and stream. No pore-water was extracted from the pre-settlement deposits due to unsaturated conditions. Water sampling was carried out for about 14 months (July, 2011 - September, 2012) on biweekly basis except last 2 months in order to evaluate temporal and spatial biogeochemical dynamics of floodplain aquifer under a variety of meteorological and hydrologic conditions. In total, 103 soil pore-water samples were collected and analyzed for DOC, Fe and Mn, pH, temperature, alkalinity, conductivity, major anions, major cations, dD, and d18O.",

    "abstract": "This is project presents data related to discharge measurements from the Bisley Watershed in the Luquillo Mountains. Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year.

Samples were not collected if weather inhibited site access. Groundwater samples were collected by the BcCZO. More information on these wells can be retrieved at: http://criticalzone.org/boulder/data/dataset/2788/.   \n\nWater samples were returned to the laboratory and filtered through 0.7m combusted glass fiber filters within 24 hours of collection. Samples were stored in the dark at 4Â°C until analysis.    \n\nUV-vis was run on an Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer (absorbance range 190-1100nm). Samples with an absorbance greater than 0.2cm-1 at 254nm were diluted to less than 0.2cm-1. Fluorescence was run on a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-3 Fluorometer.

Integration time = 0.25s, slitwidth = 5nm. EEMs were then corrected for instrument response and inner-filter effect [Cory et al., 2010; Lawaetz and Stedmon, 2009]. The following spectroscopic indices were retrieved from the corrected EEM:   \n\n1. Fluorescence Index: Ratio of emission intensity at 470nm to intensity at 520nm at excitation 370nm [McKnight et al., 2001].   \n\n2. Humification Index: Area under the peak from 435-480nm emission dived by the area under the peak from 300-345 emission at excitation 254nm [Zsolnay et al., 1999; Ohno, 2002].   \n\n3. Freshness Index: Ratio of the intensity at emission 380nm divided by the maximum intensity between 420nm -435nm at excitation 310nm [Parlanti et al., 2000; Wilson and Zenopoulous, 2008].   \n\nAn eight component site-specific PARAFAC model was used to analyze the data [Gabor et al.

The Critical Zone is the near-surface region that supports terrestrial life, extending vertically from the base of groundwater to the upper reaches of the vegetation canopy. The Boulder Creek Watershed is about 1160km2 and drains the Front Range from the Continental Divide (4120m) to the eastern plains (1480) (Murphy, 2000). In the upper reaches of Boulder Creek, it has 3 tributaries â\u0080\u0093 North Boulder Creek, Middle Boulder Creek and South Boulder Creek. The confluence of North Boulder Creek and Middle Boulder Creek is at ?m. South Boulder Creek joins Boulder Creek near the City of Boulder. The large elevation range within the watershed encompasses five climatic zones â\u0080\u0093 alpine, subalpine, montane, foothills and plains. Total annual precipitation generally decreases with elevation, from gt;100cm at the Continental Divide to about 46cm near the City of Boulder.

    "abstract": "Channel Morphology Surveys \n\t\t\t\t\nKey science question:\nâ\u0080¢ How does stream channel morphology respond to the addition of impervious cover in a humid tropical region adjusted to frequent large storms?\n\nUrbanization through the addition of impervious cover can alter catchment hydrology, often resulting in increased peak flows during floods. This phenomenon and the resulting impact on stream channel morphology is well documented in temperate climatic regions, but not well documented in the humid tropics where urbanization is rapidly occurring. This study investigates the long-term effects of urbanization on channel morphology in the humid sub-tropical region of Puerto Rico, an area characterized by frequent high-magnitude flows, and steep coarse-grained rivers. Grain size, low-flow channel roughness, and the hydraulic geometry of streams across a land-use gradient that ranges from pristine forest to high density urbanized catchments are compared. In areas that have been urbanized for several decades changes in channel features were measurable, but were smaller than those reported for comparable temperate streams. Decades of development has resulted in increased fine sediment and anthropogenic debris in urbanized catchments. Materials of anthropogenic origin comprise an average of 6% of the bed material in streams with catchments with 15% or greater impervious cover. At-a-station hydraulic geometry shows that velocity makes up a larger component of discharge for rural\nchannels, while depth contributes a larger component of discharge in urban catchments. The average bank-full cross-sectional area of urbanized reaches was 1.5 times larger than comparable forested reaches, and less than the world average increase of 2.5. On average, stream width at bank-full height did not change with urbanization while the world average increase is 1.5 times. Overall, this study indicates that the morphologic changes that occur in response to urban runoff are less in channels that are already subject to frequent large magnitude storms. Furthermore, this study suggests that developing regions in the humid tropics shouldnâ\u0080\u0099t rely on temperate analogues to determine the magnitude of impact of urbanization on stream morphology.",

    "abstract": "Water samples from rainfall, stream, and wells.  Major solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Si). \n\t\t\t\t\nSignificant solute flux from the weathered bedrock zone - which underlies soils and saprolite - has been suggested by many studies. However, controlling processes for the hydrochemistry dynamics in this zone are poorly understood. This work reports the first results from a four-year (2009-2012) high-frequency (1-3 day) monitoring of major solutes (Ca, Mg, Na, K and Si) in the perched, dynamic groundwater in a 4000 m2 zero-order basin located at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve, Northern California. Groundwater samples were autonomously collected at three wells (downslope, mid-slope, and upslope) aligned with the axis of the drainage. Rain and throughfall samples, profiles of well headspace pCO2, vertical profiles and time series of groundwater temperature, and contemporaneous data from an extensive hydrologic and climate sensor network provided the framework for data analysis. \n\nAll runoff at this soil-mantled site occurs by vertical unsaturated flow through a 5-25 m thick weathered argillite and then by lateral flows to the adjacent channel as groundwater perched over fresher bedrock. Driven by strongly seasonal rainfall, over each of the four years of observations, the hydrochemistry of the groundwater at each well repeats an annual cycle, which can be explained by two end-member processes. The first end-member process, which dominates during the winter high-flow season in mid- and upslope areas, is CO2 enhanced cation exchange reaction in the vadose zone in the more shallow conductive weathered bedrock. This process rapidly increases the cation concentrations of the infiltrated rainwater, which is responsible for the lowest cation concentration of groundwater. The second-end member process occurs in the deeper perched groundwater and either dominates year-round (at the downslope well) or becomes progressively dominant during low flow season at the two upper slope wells. This process is the equilibrium reaction with minerals such as calcite and clay minerals, but not with primary minerals, suggesting the critical role of the residence time of the water. Collectively, our measurements reveal that the hydrochemistry dynamics of the groundwater in the weathered bedrock zone is governed by two end-member processes whose dominance varies with critical zone structure, the relative importance of vadose versus groundwater zone processes, and thus with the seasonal variation of the chemistry of recharge and runoff.",

    "abstract": "This is project presents data related to discharge measurements from the Bisley Watershed in the Luquillo Mountains.Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.; PUBLICATIONS: DEFAULT_PARAMTER.UTCOffset = -4DEFAULT_PARAMETER.TimeZone = ASTDEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataBeginsOnRow = 5DEFAULT_PARAMETER.NoDataValue =-6999DEFAULT_PARAMETER.sitecode = 20DEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupport =DEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupportUnits =DEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataFile = Q1D_5-6-11to1-9-12.csv",

This dataset, together with 2010 LiDAR datasets, are being used to quantify extreme post-fire landscape changes.  \n\nDEM was made using the same smoothness parameters (in terrascan) as the 2010 DEM data sets. this 2012 data is important for anyone who wants to difference the 2010 and 2012 bare-earth DEMs. The differences between 2010 and 2012 surveys is in the horizontal and vertical datums. The 2012 survey was referenced to the current iteration of NAD83 which is  NAD_83(2011)(EPOCH:2010.0000) and the 2010 survey was referenced to the then-current iteration of NAD83 which was NAD_83(CORS96)(EPOCH:2002.0000). The error between these two datum realizations is less than 1 cm. The vertical datum for 2010 data was based on GEOID 03 and for 2012 data was GEOID 09. The error for these GEOID models is less than 6 cm. Both horizontal and datum errors are smaller than estimated survey horizontal and elevation accuracies (1 sigma). \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t***Dataset DOI:10.5069/G9319SVB",

    "abstract": "Parent Material and Topography Determine Soil Phosphorus Status in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico \n\t\t\t\t\nPhosphorus (P) availability in terrestrial ecosystems depends on soil age, climate, parent material, topographic position, and biota, but the relative\nimportance of these drivers has not been assessed. To ask which factor has the strongest influence on long- and short-timescale metrics of P availability, we sampled soils across a full-factorial combination of two parent materials [quartz diorite (QD) and volcaniclastic (VC)], three topographic positions (ridge, slope, and valley), and across 550 m in elevation in 17 sub-watersheds of the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico. VC rocks had double the P content of QD (600 vs. 300 ppm; P < 0.0001), and soil P was similarly approximately 29 higher in VC-derived soils (P < 0.0001). Parent material also explained the most variance in our two other longtimescale metrics of P status: the fraction of recalcitrant P (56% variance explained) and the loss of P relative to parent material (35% variance explained), both of which were higher on VC-derived soils (P < 0.0001 for both). Topographic position explained an additional 10â\u0080\u009315% of the variance in these metrics. In contrast, there was no parent material effect on the more labile NaHCO3- and NaOH-extractable P soil pools, which were approximately 2.59 greater in valleys than on ridges (P < 0.0001). Taken together, these data suggest that the relative importance of different state factors varies depending on the ecosystem property of interest and that parent material and topography can play sub-equal roles in driving differences in ecosystem P status across landscapes. \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: One time collection of soil samples in summer of 2010 and more sites sampled in 2011.",

The motivation for this data collection was to evaluate the spatial variability of inputs from hillslope soils to the SSHCZO stream from soils; however, dry conditions precluded soil water collection and efforts shifted to evaluating water chemistry in the larger Shaver Creek watershed. The stream at Shale Hills was not flowing during sample collection; thus samples were obtained from stagnant pools of water.

    "abstract": "The COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) involves measuring low-energy cosmic-ray neutrons above the ground, whose intensity is inversely correlated with soil water content and with water in any form above ground level (Note: the contributions from subsurface and surface waters are distinguishable). The instrument, called a \"cosmic-ray moisture probe,\" is brand new, but it is built on existing technologies that are put together in an innovative way. The use of such tried and tested technologies means the instrument and the technique are less likely to fail when deployed. It is proposed to use this novel technique to measure soil moisture content (and/or snow/vegetation water) in a network of 500 cosmicray water probes installed across the USA. Most probes will be installed in existing facilities, which will simplify the logistics, make the probes secure, and facilitate long-term operations and maintenance.

Most installation occurred in the summer of 2015 and will likely be completed in November/December 2015. Gas sampling of existing wells commenced 7-31-15 and has proceeded approximately every 3 weeks since then. The gas wells target 3 different land forms: flat uplands, mid-slopes, and steeper slopes in 3 different land use comparisons. The land uses consist of 3 reference hardwood forests minimally degraded by human activity, 3 old-field secondary succession pine forests >60 years old, and 1 pseudo-replicated agricultural plot which has been, to the best of our knowledge, continually cultivated from the 1930â\u0080\u0099s at the latest. The goal of this sampling is to identify anthropogenic biogeochemical signals in the deep soil profile of cultivated lands and to evaluate their persistence or lack thereof in old-field pine forests relative to reference hardwoods. Soil gas is analyzed in the field for O2 using an Apogee oxygen meter and all other (greenhouse) gasses are analyzed on a Varian gas chromatograph with known concentration standards. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Gasses analyzed/measured include O2, CO2, N2O, and CH4.

This was done primarily to provide concise values for publication in paper reports. In more recent years, and particularly since the USGS began making real-time instantaneous data available on NWISWeb in 1994, more attention has been given to historical instantaneous data and USGS offices have received increasing requests for these data. Some challenges with meeting those requests are:\n\nMost historical instantaneous data are paper based and were never stored on a computer or were deleted from computers after the computation of the daily values in order to save computer storage space. In most cases this data still exists as original field records, but it is a significant effort to create digital data from the paper-based records.\nInstantaneous data have not historically received the same level of quality control as the official published daily values. For example, periods of fouling may affect the calculation of daily values for a water-quality parameter. In these situations, daily values are typically not published but erroneous instantaneous data remain in the database.\nIn developing a system to provide historical instantaneous data, the USGS has built a process that compares the available instantaneous data to the published daily values and assigns an accuracy code based on the result. Accuracy codes are as follows:\n\n0 - The published daily mean* value for a water-quality parameter is zero.\n1 - A daily mean* value for a water-quality parameter, calculated from the instantaneous data on this day, matches the published daily mean* within 1 percent.\n2 - A daily mean* value for a water-quality parameter, calculated from the instantaneous data on this day, matches the published daily mean* from greater than 1 to 5 percent.\n3 - A daily mean* value for a water-quality parameter, calculated from the instantaneous values on this day, matches the published daily mean* from greater than 5 to 10 percent. \n*Subsequent to 1999 median is used as the comparative statistic for pH\nIf the daily mean (or median when appropriate) water-quality parameter calculated from the instantaneous values on a given day is greater than 10 percent different from the published daily mean or median, those instantaneous values are excluded from the archive. In addition, instantaneous data that corresponds to a daily mean or median value that was estimated are automatically excluded from the archive regardless of any comparison. \nAn additional classification is available at those limited sites where quality assurance of individual instantaneous data has been done. When this classification is used there is no comparison to the daily mean values. \n9 - The instantaneous value is considered correct by the collecting USGS Water Science Center. A published daily mean value does not exist and/or no comparison was made.\nIt is important to note that, other than for classification code 9, the values available in the archive have not been individually reviewed and approved. They have been automatically compared against the published daily mean value and found to have no gross errors when used to compute a daily mean. Individual instantaneous values may still have significant error. For example a data spike might cause a given value to be off by several hundred percent, yet when combined with the other available values in the daily mean calculation the result might lead that spike to get added to the archive with an accuracy code of 2 or 3 because the impact on the daily mean is less than 5%. Users of the archive are thus strongly encouraged to review all data prior to use. \nA cursory review of all processed water-quality data, the oldest of which date back to October 1985, took place prior to public distribution. Apparent erroneous data â\u0080\u009cspikesâ\u0080\u009d were addressed in the following ways based on the best judgment of the reviewer:\na. Data were removed when determined to be an obvious error and the correct value could not be estimated based on adjacent data.\nb. Data were corrected if adjacent data provided a reasonable degree of confidence as to what the correct value should be.\nc. Data were left as is if the questionable value was at least minimally feasible, allowing the user of the data to make the final determination. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Processing and quality control of this historical dataset was co-funded by an NSF supplement to the White Clay Creek LTREB project (NSF award 1052716) and by internal funds from the USGS PA Water Science Center.  Coordination was supported by the CRB-CZO project (NSF award 0724971). \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: 30 min to 1 hour intervals",

Prenart suction cups are optimized for all chemistry analyses and were installed without addition of Si-slurry to allow for artifact-free Si analyses. Applied suction for each Prenart is ~ 60kPa. ii) Custom made, fiberglass wick-based passive capillary wick samplers (PCaps, Perdrial et al. 2012). PCaps are optimized for water flux determination and sampling for organic carbon, most anions and metals. PCap samples should however not be used for major cations (Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca) and dissolved inorganic carbon because of artifacts from the fiberglass materials (see Perdrial et al in prep. For a complete list). Passive suction, based on the length of the hanging water column, is ~3 kPa. Soil solution samplers were installed in each of six pits in the Mixed Conifer Zero Order Basin (MC-ZOB) and the fire impacted site (burn ZOB) at 3 (PCaps) and 4 (Prenarts) depth, respectively. Pit locations were selected to capture differences in catchment aspect (MC-ZOB SE facing: Pit 3 and 4, NW facing: Pit 1 and 6), landscape position (MC-ZOB: hollow Pit 2 and 5, planar Pit 1 and 6, divergent Pit 3, convergent Pit 4), elevation and burn severity (co-varying in Burn ZOB: low Pit 1 and 2, mid Pit 3, high Pit 4 to 6).

Three locations were TLS surveyed a total of four times over the course of two years. The locations are the Debris1 alluvial fan, Debris2 alluvial fan, and the BurnZOB small upland basin. The four surveys were completed after the Las Conchas fire in the summer of 2011. The approximate dates for each scan were 8/19/11, 6/4/12, 9/22/12, and 5/14/13. \n\nAll TLS data was collected using a Leica C10 scanner set up in the field by Jon Pelletier and Caitlin Orem. All scans were scanned for both points (on the medium scan setting) and photographs (meaning pictures were taken to then extrapolate RGB data from for each point). GPS data was collected in the field with a Leica Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) unit. At each scan station at least three permanently located targets were scanned so all scans at a study site could be registered to one point cloud. At least three targets at each study site were surveyed with Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) receivers until a temporary accuracy reading of less than 0.01 m was reached in each of the four cardinal directions. \n\nAll scans for each individual survey were uploaded to Leica Cyclone so scans could be registered together into one point cloud. GPS data for the base station was processed in Leica Geo Office and imported into Cyclone to georeference the point cloud. Data was then exported from Cyclone in .pts format (columns of x, y, z, intensity, r, g, b). Cloud Compare software was used to take the .pts file to .las.  \n\nHorizontal coordinate system is UTM 13N WGS84 METERS.\n\nVertical coordinate system is NAVD88. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: All collections start early (~7 am) the first day and end mid-afternoon on second day.

    "abstract": "Nutrient fluxes in rainfall and throughfall have been measured weekly in a maturesubtropical wet forest in NE Puerto Rico for over a 15-year period that included the effectsof 10 named tropical storms, several prolonged dry periods, and volcanic activity in theregion. During the first 15 years mean annual rainfall and throughfall were 3482 and 2131 mm/yr, respectively.  Average annual rainfall and throughfall fluxes of K, Ca, Mg, Cl, Na, and SO4â\u0080\u0093S were similar but somewhat larger than those reported for most tropical forests. Rainfall inputs of nitrogenwere comparatively low and reflect the relative isolation of the airshed.  More constituentshad seasonal differences in rainfall fluxes (6 out of 12) than throughfall fluxes (4 outof 12) and all volume weighted throughfall enrichment ratios calculated for the 15-yearperiod were greater than one. However, median weekly enrichment ratios were less than1 for sea salts and dissolved organic carbon, between 1 and 2 for Mg, Ca, SiO2 and SO4â\u0080\u0093S,and greater than 10 for NH4â\u0080\u0093N, PO4â\u0080\u0093P, and K.; Rainfall and throughfall are collected weekly at the Bisley LEF site.

They are the source of floods, which are among the Nation's most severe natural disasters, both in loss of life and in economic damage. They provide the habitat, spawning grounds, and avenues of movement for fish. Streams are a source of great recreational activity in terms of boating, fishing, and simple enjoyment of visiting and viewing the stream and its environs. Finally, streams are indicators of the condition of the landscape. They integrate effects from their entire watershed. \n\nSurface-water information collected at these streamflow-measurement stations is used for surveillance, planning, design, flood warning, operation and management of dams, in water-related fields such as water supply, flood control, irrigation, bridge and culvert design, wildlife management, pollution abatement, flood-plain management, and water-resources development. \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: 15 minute intervals",

The transect in the northern edge had an approximately elevation of 640 m, and ended in the southern edge below 540 m elevation and close to the knickpoint. The GPR data along the transect revealed a series of vertical zones with presence of chaotic reflectors (Figure 1b, between 240-265m, 270-300 m, and 320-350 m along the transect; and Figure 1c, between 690-750 m along the transect). These areas repeated at several locations along the 2 km transect (white lines in Figure 1a). Other GPR reflector facies signatures (not shown here) included two landslide locations (yellow lines in Figure 1a); and an area of laterally continuous reflectors (blue line in Figure 1a) towards the end of the transect and close to the knickpoint.\nTerrain conductivity surveys consistently depict a) increases in terrain conductivity; and b) decreases in magnetic susceptibility that coincide with the vertical zones of chaotic GPR reflectors described above (shaded areas in Figures 1b and 1c)\nWe attribute these areas of enhanced GPR reflections to vertical fracturing within the bedrock-regolith interface associated with the formation of corestones.  Water infiltration may cause regolith wash off (resulting in a decrease in electrical conductivity) and concentration of  corestones (resulting in increases in magnetic susceptibility). This preliminary hypothesis is confirmed by the presence of large corestones adjacent to the transect (Figure 1d) and following topographic valley areas (Figure 1a). \nThese results confirm the potential of hydrogeophysical measurements for understanding variability of bedrock-regolith interface in the Icacos watershed at large (i.e. km) scales and have direct implications for the controls on subsurface fluid circulation and presence of preferential groundwater flow.",

At Transect A of the White Clay Creek Watershed (WCCW) of the CRB-CZO, the composition of soil pore-waters and stream was investigated to understand how the geochemical dynamics of Fe- and Mn- along redox gradients affect the C cycle within a floodplain aquifer. \nSoil pore-water was collected with in-situ borosilicate glass samplers (50 mm long, 20 mm diameter, 1 Âµm pore size, Ecotech, Germany) with the attached PTFE (Teflon) tubes (3/1.5 mm i.d./o.d) to sampling bottle. Six samplers were deployed on both sides of the floodplain within a 10-40 cm thick dark organic-rich silty soil that represents a buried pre-settlement wetland soil, underlain gravel, and stream. No pore-water was extracted from the pre-settlement deposits due to unsaturated conditions. Water sampling was carried out for about 14 months (July, 2011 - September, 2012) on biweekly basis except last 2 months in order to evaluate temporal and spatial biogeochemical dynamics of floodplain aquifer under a variety of meteorological and hydrologic conditions. In total, 103 soil pore-water samples were collected and analyzed for DOC, Fe and Mn, pH, temperature, alkalinity, conductivity, major anions, major cations, dD, and d18O.",

    "abstract": "Effective Energy and Mass Transfer for Valles Caldera \n\t\t\t\t\nYearly effective energy and mass transfer (EEMT) (MJ m-2 yr-1) was calculated for the Valles Calders, upper part of the Jemez River basin by summing the 12 monthly values. Effective energy and mass flux varies seasonally, especially in the desert southwestern United States where contemporary climate includes a bimodal precipitation distribution that concentrates in winter (rain or snow depending on elevation) and summer monsoon periods. This seasonality of EEMT flux into the upper soil surface can be estimated by calculating EEMT on a monthly basis as constrained by solar radiation (Rs), temperature (T), precipitation (PPT), and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD): EEMT = f(Rs,T,PPT,VPD). Here we used a multiple linear regression model to calculate the monthly EEMT that accounts for VPD, PPT, and locally modified T across the terrain surface. These EEMT calculations were made using data from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University (www.prismclimate.org). Climate data are provided at an 800-m spatial resolution for input precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature normals and at a 4000-m spatial resolution for dew-point temperature (Daly et al., 2002). The PRISM climate data, however, do not account for localized variation in EEMT that results from smaller spatial scale changes in slope and aspect as occurs within catchments. To address this issue, these data were then combined with 10-m digital elevation maps to compute the effects of local slope and aspect on incoming solar radiation and hence locally modified temperature (Yang et al., 2007). Monthly average dew-point temperatures were computed using 10 yr of monthly data (2000â\u0080\u00932009) and converted to vapor pressure. Precipitation, temperature, and dew-point data were resampled on a 10-m grid using spline interpolation. Monthly solar radiation data (direct and diffuse) were computed using ArcGIS Solar Analyst extension (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and 10-m elevation data (USGS National Elevation Dataset [NED] 1/3 Arc-Second downloaded from the National Map Seamless Server at seamless.usgs.gov). Locally modified temperature was used to compute the saturated vapor pressure, and the local VPD was estimated as the difference between the saturated and actual vapor pressures. The regression model was derived using the ISOHYS climate data set comprised of approximately 30-yr average monthly means for more than 300 weather stations spanning all latitudes and longitudes (IAEA). \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Detailed computation and data resources are described in the file EEMT_Radiation_Dew.pdf",

    "abstract": ". This is project presents data related to discharge measurements from the Bisley Watershed in the Luquillo Mountains. Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.; PUBLICATIONS: .

    "abstract": "Effective Energy and Mass Transfer for Catalinas \n\t\t\t\t\nYearly effective energy and mass transfer (EEMT) (MJ m-2 yr-1) was calculated for the Catalina Mountains by summing the 12 monthly values. Effective energy and mass flux varies seasonally, especially in the desert southwestern United States where contemporary climate includes a bimodal precipitation distribution that concentrates in winter (rain or snow depending on elevation) and summer monsoon periods. This seasonality of EEMT flux into the upper soil surface can be estimated by calculating EEMT on a monthly basis as constrained by solar radiation (Rs), temperature (T), precipitation (PPT), and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD): EEMT = f(Rs,T,PPT,VPD). Here we used a multiple linear regression model to calculate the monthly EEMT that accounts for VPD, PPT, and locally modified T across the terrain surface. These EEMT calculations were made using data from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University (www.prismclimate.org). Climate data are provided at an 800-m spatial resolution for input precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature normals and at a 4000-m spatial resolution for dew-point temperature (Daly et al., 2002). The PRISM climate data, however, do not account for localized variation in EEMT that results from smaller spatial scale changes in slope and aspect as occurs within catchments. To address this issue, these data were then combined with 10-m digital elevation maps to compute the effects of local slope and aspect on incoming solar radiation and hence locally modified temperature (Yang et al., 2007). Monthly average dew-point temperatures were computed using 10 yr of monthly data (2000â\u0080\u00932009) and converted to vapor pressure. Precipitation, temperature, and dew-point data were resampled on a 10-m grid using spline interpolation. Monthly solar radiation data (direct and diffuse) were computed using ArcGIS Solar Analyst extension (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and 10-m elevation data (USGS National Elevation Dataset [NED] 1/3 Arc-Second downloaded from the National Map Seamless Server at seamless.usgs.gov). Locally modified temperature was used to compute the saturated vapor pressure, and the local VPD was estimated as the difference between the saturated and actual vapor pressures. The regression model was derived using the ISOHYS climate data set comprised of approximately 30-yr average monthly means for more than 300 weather stations spanning all latitudes and longitudes (IAEA). \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Detailed computation and data resources are described in the file EEMT_Radiation_Dew.pdf",

These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

    "abstract": "USGS/CCWRA Sample based water quality data \n\t\t\t\t\nSince 1969, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Chester County Water Resources Authority have conducted a cooperative program to evaluate stream ecology and water-quality conditions using benthic macroinvertebrates and stream-water chemistry. The Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has sampled streams every fall for over 30 years. The initial goals of the program were to evaluate stream-water quality and to further the understanding of changes in the stream ecosystem in response to urbanization. The current goals of the program are to use the data to monitor current conditions and determine trends. Data from the program have been used to help support Chester County Landscapes by providing information on biological diversity and water-quality conditions. Without monitoring it is impossible to determine if changes in land use or environmental policies and regulation are having a positive affect on water quality.\n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are macroscopic animals that inhabit the bottoms of aquatic habitats. Freshwater forms include aquatic insects and other invertebrates including clams, crustaceans, snails, and worms. Factors such as streamflow, food availability, habitat, temperature, and water quality determine the makeup of the macroinvertebrate community. By sampling in similar habitats with similar physical conditions, water quality becomes the determining factor controlling community structure. Changes in abundance, diversity, species richness, and presence or absence of pollution tolerant or intolerant species can be measured and related to water quality. Trends in water quality can be determined by sampling at a single location over several years and observing changes to the community structure. \n\nBenthic macroinvertebrates are well suited as water-quality indicators because of their biology and availability. They are present in most aquatic systems and are relatively easy to collect. They are indicators of overall water quality and can be used to identify specific types and sources of degraded water quality. Benthic macroinvertebrates have limited mobility and cannot avoid poor water-quality conditions. They are sensitive to a wide range of environmental impacts including chemical and physical impairments. \n\nBiological samples collected for the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network consist of benthic macroinvertebrates collected from a riffle area of the stream. A riffle habitat is used because macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance is usually highest there. \n\nSample collection and identification methods remained consistent from 1970 through 1997. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected by taking 10 rocks (45-90 millimeters in diameter) at random. Water-quality conditions were determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation of Brillouin's Diversity Index. In this index, diversity is high if a community contains many organisms that are evenly distributed; diversity is low if there are few organisms that are unevenly distributed. Brillouin's diversity index values greater than 3.0 are associated with waters receiving little or no organic wastes. Values between 1.0 and 3.0 are associated with waters receiving moderate organic wastes, and values below 1.0 are associated with waters receiving heavy organic wastes.\n\nA new sampling protocol for the Stream Conditions of Chester County Biological Monitoring Network was established in 1998 to update the program and meet the county's current needs. The new sampling protocols are based on Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBP) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Samples are collected from areas of various velocities from within a riffle. Water-quality conditions are determined by analysis of the community structure and calculation of various metrics including total individuals, taxa richness, Brillouin's Diversity Index, Hilsonhoff Biotic Index, EPT taxa richness, percent EPT taxa, and percent dominate taxa. This sampling method will allow the county to compare results with those from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, universities, local watershed associations, and other federal agencies that are using RBP's. \n\nSampling locations were adjusted in 1998 to relocate the sampling sites to better meet the county's needs. Twenty-seven sites are samples each year. Eighteen sites are fixed integrator or reference sites (see table below). These fixed integrator sites are sampled every year. Nine sites are selected each year to assess the water quality in areas of interest to the county. The realignment of sampling sites provides better spatial coverage while increasing flexibility. The increased flexibility allows for the placement of sites to study the effects on water-quality of specific events such as road construction or residential and business developments. This makes the program capable of both short-term and long-term evaluation of stream-water quality.\n\nThe Stream Conditions of Chester County Program has determined that the quality of Chester County streams has greatly improved since 1970. Current benthic macroinvertebrate communities are more diverse and contain more pollution sensitive species compared to communities sampled at the beginning of the program. Forty-five of forty-six sites analyzed between 1970 and 1986 had a statistically significant increase in diversity.",

All cores were visually crossdated using a master chronology developed from P. ponderosa of the central Front Range.    \nMultiple tree cores were collected per sample plot (spatial resolution for tree coordinates is plot level).    \nTree core data date range: 1833-2013     \n\nFoliage samples were collected from branches exposed to full sun in the upper 1/3 of the canopy. Samples were dried (35C for 50 hrs), ground, and extracted to holocellulose (Leavitt and Danzer 1993). Holocellulose samples were combusted in an elemental analyzer (Carlo Erba EA 1110 Series, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and analyzed by continuous flow mass spectrometry (VG/Fisons SIRA Series II mass spectrometer, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) to determine the 13C isotope composition at the University of Colorado.    \nStable isotope abundance of d13C is expressed relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite standard (Farquhar et al. 1989):\nd^13 C(â\u0080°)=(R_sample/R_standard -1)Ã\u00971000 \nwhere R is the ratio of 13C to 12C of the sample or standard. Precision of analysis was 0.12 â\u0080° and accuracy was 0.04 â\u0080°.     \nFoliar nitrogen was measured using a Thermo Finnigan FLASH EA 1112 Series CHN Analyzer at the University of Colorado.    \nTree Foliage Data Date Range: 2011-2012     \n\nFor additional methodology information, refer to Adams, H. R., H. R. Barnard, and A. K. Loomis. 2014. Topography alters tree growth - climate relationships in a semi-arid forested catchment. Ecosphere.",

This tropical setting has steep environmental gradients, a varied natural disturbance regime, and a history of human land use. Of the mountain area 11,330 hectares are included in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), which is congruent with the El Yunque National Forest, part of the U.S. National Forest system. The mountains rise to over 1075 m. Prevailing winds coming off the ocean from the east drop rain as they rise over the mountains; thus rainfall increases with elevation, ranging from about 3530 mm year-1 at low elevations to 4850 mm year-1 higher up. February through April are the drier months, but monthly rainfall is variable. Mean monthly temperatures at lowest elevations range from about 23.5ÂºC in January to 27ÂºC in September, and at the highest elevations from 17ÂºC to 20ÂºC (see article Climate and Hydrology in this web page). \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\nDATE RANGE COMMENTS: Ongoing",

These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

Some samples were sporadically collected from springs and major streams and their tributaries around Redondo Peak. Temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field. Water samples were analyzed in PI laboratories at the University of Arizona for anions, cations, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and total nitrogen, stable water isotopes, alkalinity, and nutrients (NH4-N and Orthophosphate). Select water samples were analyzed for carbon stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon. Precipitation (snow and rain) samples were collected around Redondo Peak using 3 bulk rainfall samplers (next to the Lower La Jara Flume under canopy coverage to sample throughfall, next to the Upper Jaramillo Flume in open space, and next to the ZOB meteorological station in open space), 2 automatic rain samplers installed in open space (one next to the Head Quarters meteorological station and one nearby the Upper Jaramillo flume), and 2 snow lysimeters and snow profile samples from various locations.

Sampling is underway, though all soil texture samples have been collected and are in process. The first quarterly invertebrate sampling occurred in September 2015. Bulk density, Ksat, and water stable aggregate sampling and analyses will occur in 2016. This work targets 3 different land forms: flat uplands, mid-slopes, and steeper slopes in 3 different land use comparisons. The land uses consist of 3 reference hardwood forests minimally degraded by human activity, 3 old-field secondary succession pine forests >60 yo, and 1 pseudo-replicated agricultural plot which has been, to the best of our knowledge, continually cultivated from the 1930â\u0080\u0099s at the latest. The goal of this sampling is to identify physical anthropogenic signals in the upper meters in the soil profile of cultivated lands and to evaluate their persistence or lack thereof in old-field pine forests relative to reference hardwoods. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Properties analyzed/measured include water stable aggregates, texture, bulk density, Ksat, soil macroinvertebrates. Biological/invertebrate samples are collected from the litter and upper 30cm of the soil profile in a 30x30cm cube. Water stable aggregates, bulk density, and Ksat will be derived for at least the upper 2m of the profile. Soil texture is calculated from the surface to 5m depth.

    "abstract": "Nutrient fluxes for rainfall and throughfall in the Bisley watersheds; Bisley Weekly Rainfall flux \n\t\t\t\t\nChanges in the quantity and quality of precipitation as it passes through vegetative cover are important components of both hydrologic and nutrient budgets.\n\nThroughfall over any period depends on the balance between precipitation, evaporation and canopy storage (Horton, 1919; Leonard, 1967; Rutter et al., 1972). If the watershed is divided into different vegetation types based on similarity in throughfall and steamflow, the total throughfall over the watershed can be expressed as:\n\n(1) Pg = Sum( T n A n )+ Sum (Sm Dm)\n\nWhere Pg = total throughfall reaching the ground, Tn = canopy throughfall from vegetation type n, An = area of vegetation type n, Sm = stemflow from stem type m and Dm = number of stems in type m.\n\nUsing eqn. (1) to estimate total watershed throughfall becomes a problem of determining the minimum number of vegetation types necessary to describe the system at the required level of accuracy. In one of our studies, measured throughfall was compared with actual canopy and stem conditions to estimate the percentages of throughfall for different time periods was calculated by weighting the average throughfall and stemflow measured in representative areas of each vegetation type by the total area of that vegetation group.\n\nMeasurements reported here were made in two of the Bisley Research Watershed of the U.S. Forest Service. These adjacent watersheds drain 13.0 ha of highly dissected mountainous terrain that range in elevation from 265 to 455 m. Both watersheds are covered by Tabonuco type forests and were selectively logged at various times between 1860 and 1940 (Scatena, 1988).\nThe dominant tree in the watersheds in the Tabonuco ( Dacryodes excelsa ) which often comprises as much as 35% of the canopy ( Wadsworth, 1970). Structurally the forest has three dominant layers, a discontinuous emergent strata, a continuous upper stratum at 20 m, and an understory layer. Leaves are mesophyllous and often covered with epiphytic growth.",

Following the classic paradigm, we assessed the influence of climate (modeled precipitation, modeled temperature and/or elevation as a surrogate variable for both), forest type (tabonuco, colorado, palm), parent material (quartz diorite, volcaniclastics), and topography (catena positions ridge, slope, valley and % slope) on the distribution of these nutrients. To separate the effects of vegetation from those of climate, half of the sites were located between 500 and 700 m in the three forest types where rainfall and temperature were not significantly different. Using a combination of ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis) and univariate regression trees we determined that the amount of carbon in the top 80 cm of soil was influenced primarily by forest type (c > p > t) probably driven by differences in litter and/or root C:N ratios. Topographic position was significantly correlated with C amount (v > s, r), with the higher C amounts in the valleys probably driven by low O2 levels. Bedrock type was significantly correlated with C amount in c and p stands, but not in the tabonuco type. N was strongly correlated with C as expected. Exchangeable Ca was different across forest types (t > c, p) and bedrock type (qd > vc). Mg and K were differed by forest type, but not by bedrock type (t > c, p) or any other variables.\nThe next phases of this project are (1) to determine levels of these nutrients below the root zone (80-140 cm) and the factors controlling their distribution; and (2) establish field experiments to test the results of the regression trees which indicate that the C:N ratio of litter and/or root inputs is the most important variable influencing C distribution. The latter represents a first step in exploring the usefulness of regression trees as a way of sorting out the relative importance of each of the state factors (climate, topography, organisms, parent material and time) in the classic paradigm relating environmental variables to soil properties.\nSoil C differs markedly across forest types (c> p> t, p s, r, p",

    "abstract": "East Peak Climate \n\t\t\t\t\nTemperature (T)\nThe hourly temperature (T) series of the East peak (EP) site were checked for quality by comparing them against the hourly T data of the lower Bisley tower (352 m a.s.l.). This comparison allowed for identifying periods during which T measurements were erroneous due to sensor drift, power failures, or any other reason. Temporary drift (caused by e.g. condensation) or spikes could be fairly well identified, and the data subject to these problems were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s.\n\nRadiation data, incoming solar radiation (Sin)\nThe values of incoming solar radiation (Sin) measured at EP have been recorded using multipliers provided by LI-COR. This is not correct, however. Although the pyranometers were manufactured by LI-COR, the sensors were bought from Campbell Scientific (CS). CS adapts the sensors to make them compatible with their data loggers. The adaptation consists of fitting the cable of the sensor with a resistor that is set to give a fixed output (or sensitivity) of 200 W m-2 mV-1 (see CS manual for the LI200X pyranometer). Hence, each sensor has a sensitivity of 200 W m-2 mV-1.\n\nRelative humidity (RH)\nThe hourly data were first graphed and visually checked for obvious errors such as e.g. spikes (due to e.g. sensor failure or power issues) and the erroneous data were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s.\n\nRadiation data, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)\nThe Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) data were first visually checked for obvious errors (e.g. out of range data) and the erroneous data were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s. Next, daily PAR totals as measured at the EP station and the SCF station of Whendee Silver were compared with daily totals of Sin observed at the respective stations (Figure 7b). The slopes of the linear regressions of PAR against Sin as calculated from the EP and SCF data (1.77 and 1.89, respectively)\n\nWind speed (U)\nThe wind speed (U) data were first visually checked for obvious errors (e.g. out of range data) and the erroneous data were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s. . U measured at the EP station before July 2004 seems too low (data to the left of the vertical line). The average daily U for this period was 3.2 m s-1, which is considerably lower than the average value of 4.5 m s-1 measured after July 2004. The latter value compares well with the average values of 4?5 m s-1 reported for by Briscoe (1966), Baynton (1968), and Holwerda (2005).\n\nWind direction (Udir)\nThe wind direction (Udir) data were first visually checked for obvious errors (e.g. out of range data) and the erroneous data were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s. There was fair agreement between the Udir data from the EP and SCF stations. Since measurements were made over complex terrain â\u0080\u0093 where the wind direction is strongly influenced by the local topography ? differences between Udir measured at different locations are to be expected. For most of the time, winds were coming from the NE. Considering only days with winds coming from between 0? and 90?, the average Udir was 67 ? 9? for EP and 55 ? 12? for SCF. The average measured at EP (67?) is close to the average value of 72 ? 10? derived by Holwerda (2005) for the same site (using one year of data from November 2000 until October 2001).\n\nRainfall (P)\nThe rainfall (P) data from EP were compared with P measured at the SCF and TCF stations of Whendee Silver. Erroneous data due to e.g. a clogged funnel, or a malfunctioning reed switch or connection were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s. Reference data from the SCF and TCF stations were not available for the entire period. As such, parts of the EP P series could not be validated against data (Figure 13). The EP P data showed a strong linear relationship with the P data from the SCF and TCF stations (Figure 12). Hence, gaps in the EP P data were filled using linear regression. To account for changes in the calibration coefficients, separate regression relationships were derived for each gap using data from before the gap.\n\nHorizontal precipitation (HP)\nThe fog gauge data (HP) were screened for obvious errors due to e.g. a malfunctioning reed switch or a clogged funnel. The erroneous were replaced by NaNâ\u0080\u0099s. It is likely that the much higher values of HP were caused by the use of a wrong, or different multiplier in the data logger program. The multiplier that is used normally is 0.1; dividing the â\u0080\u0098too highâ\u0080\u0099 values by 10 yields values of daily HP that are close to those â\u0080\u0098normallyâ\u0080\u0099 observed (see Figure 15), suggesting that a multiplier of 1 was used for the data in blue. Hence, the data in blue were corrected by dividing by 10 . From 29 October 2009 onwards, the â\u0080\u0098Wire harpâ\u0080\u0099 fog gauge was replaced by a â\u0080\u0098Modified Juvikâ\u0080\u0099 gauge.",

In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.; PUBLICATIONS: DEFAULT_PARAMTER.UTCOffset = -4DEFAULT_PARAMETER.TimeZone = ASTDEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataBeginsOnRow = 5DEFAULT_PARAMETER.NoDataValue =-6999DEFAULT_PARAMETER.QualityControlLevel = 2DEFAULT_PARAMETER.sitecode = 21DEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupport =DEFAULT_PARAMETER.timeSupportUnits = minuteDEFAULT_PARAMETER.DataFile = Q2_15min_6-7-11to2-22-12.csv",

IN2-W Turf Tec double ring infiltrometer was used.  Inner ring diameter is 0.06 m.  Steady state tests were performed by measuring the amount of infiltration after a fixed time.  For the transient method the infiltration amount was recorded every minute.  Water was added (amount recorded) when necessary to keep the float within the recording interval.  Multiple depths were tested when possible (10, 20 30 cm).",

    "abstract": "Level 0 - Raw Data \n\t\t\t\t\nNatural gamma ray logs are indicating the concentration of thorium (Th), uranium (U), and potassium (K) in the rocks surrounding a borehole and they are a measurement of the natural radioactivity of the formation.  The energy of the gamma-rays (photons) differs for Th, U, and\nK. Potassium emits only gamma photons of energy 1.46 MeV. Thorium emits gamma photons of a number of different energies, the highest of which is 2.62 MeV. Uranium similarly emits gamma photons of a number of different energies with 1.76 MeV as the highest energy that can be detected in a borehole. Here the values indicate total gamma ray energy and are function of well depth. \n\t\t\t\t\nCOMMENTS: Wire-line logging:  The natural gamma log system consists of a gamma ray detecting probe, geophysical logging cable and a digital counter instrument. It is done by lowering the probe down the drill hole and recoding the gamma radiation variation (in count-per-second) with depth (in meters).  Two data sets for each well:  Down and Up.  Down:  From top of the well to bottom of the well.  Up:  From bottom of the well to top of the well.  Depth in meters in first column and gamma radiation variations in count-per-second in the second column.",
